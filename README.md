# GoodSpot v2

This is a revamped version of the GoodSpot project originally built for the TD Elevate Hackathon back in 2018, the code of which can be found [here (front-end)](https://github.com/wlto/goodspot) and [here (back-end)](https://github.com/wlto/goodspot-server).

This version will include code refactor on both front-end and back-end, as well as some small UI tweaks.

> Please note that not all of the code in this repository is originally mine, since I joined the hackathon with a couple of friends. I would like to give a big thank you to my friends [@moonjinyoung](https://github.com/moonjinyoung), [@CClar](https://github.com/CClar), [@abbyelee](https://github.com/abbyelee) and [@JohnDownByTheBae](https://github.com/JohnDownByTheBae) for joining this hackathon with me and contributing to the project. Their contributions can be found in the original repositories linked above.
