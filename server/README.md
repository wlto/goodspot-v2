# GoodSpot - server

This directory mainly contains code improvement and some small fixes. It is very much similar to the original code which can be found [here](https://github.com/wlto/goodspot-server). I would like to give a big thank you to my friends [@moonjinyoung](https://github.com/moonjinyoung), [@CClar](https://github.com/CClar), [@abbyelee](https://github.com/abbyelee) and [@JohnDownByTheBae](https://github.com/JohnDownByTheBae) for joining this hackathon with me and contributing to the project.
